# Bilateral Carotid Duplex Protocol
**Site:** Mount Sinai GP1C  
**Version:** 1.0.0  
**Exam ID:** carotid

## üìã Exam Overview
Real-time grayscale and color Doppler ultrasound is used to evaluate the extracranial carotid arteries bilaterally. Spectral waveforms are obtained to quantify flow velocities, assess for stenosis, and evaluate plaque morphology.

## üß† Key Segments & Evaluation Criteria

### Subclavian Arteries (Bilateral)
- Origin, Proximal, Distal
- Measurements: PSV, EDV
- Waveform analysis only

### Common Carotid Arteries (CCA)
- Proximal, Mid, Distal (Right & Left)
- Assess for plaque, obtain PSV and EDV
- Evaluate waveform morphology

### Carotid Bifurcation
- Evaluate for calcified or heterogeneous plaque
- Critical site for early stenosis

### Internal Carotid Arteries (ICA)
- Proximal, Mid, Distal (Right & Left)
- PSV and EDV recorded
- Calculate ICA/CCA ratio
- Estimate % stenosis using NASCET criteria

### External Carotid Arteries (ECA)
- PSV and EDV recorded
- Confirm with temporal tap or waveform morphology

### Vertebral Arteries
- Origin, Proximal, Mid, Distal (Right & Left)
- Assess for flow direction (antegrade vs retrograde)
- Evaluate for waveform dampening or reversal

### Temporal Arteries
- Superficial Temporal Artery (Right & Left)
- Used for suspected temporal arteritis
- Evaluate for wall thickening, elevated velocities, or stenosis
- Flow direction and plaque status noted

## üìê Stenosis Interpretation Guidelines

| ICA PSV (cm/s) | ICA EDV (cm/s) | Stenosis Estimate |
|----------------|----------------|--------------------|
| <125           | <40            | 0‚Äì19%              |
| 125‚Äì129        | 40‚Äì60          | 20‚Äì49%             |
| 130‚Äì229        | 60‚Äì99          | 50‚Äì69%             |
| ‚â•230           | ‚â•100           | 70‚Äì99%             |
| No flow        | N/A            | Occlusion          |

> **Note**: ICA/CCA ratio > 4.0 is also supportive of >70% stenosis.

## üõë QA Notes & Pitfalls
- CCA velocities should not exceed ICA unless pathology is present.
- Beware of underestimating stenosis in cases of low cardiac output.
- Temporal arteries should only be included when ordered or clinically relevant (e.g., GCA).
- Ensure proper probe angle and gate placement to avoid aliasing.

---

## üì§ Documentation & Reporting
- Segmental PSV and EDV must be entered for all visible segments.
- Plaque morphology (calcified, soft, heterogeneous) should be recorded where visible.
- Waveform and direction fields required for vertebral and temporal arteries.
- ICA/CCA ratio and % stenosis calculated automatically.
