/**
 * Axios instance configured for authentication-related requests.
 *
 * This instance is dedicated to communicating with the external Auth API,
 * which manages user login, logout, token refresh, and session validation.
 *
 * âœ… Responsibilities:
 * - Sends credentials (username/password) to obtain JWT tokens
 * - Refreshes expired tokens using the authInterceptor logic
 * - Includes `withCredentials` to support secure cookies (if used)
 * - Used by useAuth(), login/logout flows, and token validation utilities
 *
 * This instance is isolated from the main exam API to support
 * cross-origin deployment and service separation.
