"""
RunnableJulia â€“ LangGraph-compatible wrapper for Julia Agent

Julia is the developer-facing RAG agent for the Lumen platform.
This wrapper allows her to function as a modular LangGraph node
that operates on a shared DubinState.

Responsibilities:
- Receive a user question from DubinState
- Use LangChain RAG to retrieve answers from `brain/backend`
- Return the answer along with a list of source documents used
