class Exam(models.Model):
    """
    Represents a single vascular ultrasound exam.

    Each Exam is created when a scheduled study is marked 'arrived' in EPIC.
    It stores:
        - Patient metadata (MRN, DOB, accession number)
        - Exam classification (carotid, renal, etc.)
        - Exam scope/extent (bilateral, limited, etc.)
        - CPT code (auto-filled based on scope/extent)
        - Clinical context (indication, operative history, technique)
        - Gender, source, and AI-related metadata

    An Exam is the parent object for all associated Segment and Measurement data.
    It progresses through a clear workflow:
        1. Draft (tech fills out metadata and measurements)
        2. Signed by Technologist
        3. Finalized by Physician

    Output from an Exam includes:
        ✅ Editable clinical summary
        ✅ Structured PDF report (WeasyPrint)
        ✅ HL7 ORU message (to Mirth → EMR)
